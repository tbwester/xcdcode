Turned off laser, switched trigger. Removed 57Co source.

Capacitot still in. Current rate about 2 Hz.

Prepare for Kr runs.

Sunday, January 24, 2016, 15:03 Close VV6, turn of scroll pump.

Closed VC2.

Pressure stable at 17.4 psia. Flow stable at 9.6 slpm.

Sunday, January 24, 2016, 15:09 Slowly opened V6 a little bit. Waited to stabilize

Sunday, January 24, 2016, 15:14 Opened a little more ...

Sunday, January 24, 2016, 15:18 V6 fully opened. Rate still seems to be around 2.5 Hz.

Monday, January 25, 2016, 10:53 Put 57Co source in. Openend VC1 on source. Opened V6 half-way (red-green) to allow Kr to flow.
Took capacitor out.
